# MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS-2000-TO-2019
This project explores global mental health trends using multi-source datasets covering mental illness prevalence, disability burden (DALYs), treatment gaps, and data coverage from 1990 to 2019. The analysis focuses on comparing prevalence and disability across disorders and countries.
It examines major mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and eating disorders—and compares how frequently these conditions occur versus how much disability they cause.

The analysis highlights differences across countries, identifies disorders that contribute disproportionately to global disability, and surfaces gaps in mental health data coverage and treatment access. By combining long-term trends with a snapshot of the most recent year, the project provides a data-driven view of persistent challenges in global mental health and areas where improvement is needed.

Insights are presented through interactive Power BI visualizations supported by structured SQL queries, with a focus on clear interpretation and real-world relevance.
